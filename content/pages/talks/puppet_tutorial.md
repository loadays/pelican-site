Abstract
---------
[Puppet](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet) is a configuration management tool for modeling system state.

This tutorial would require that attendees arrive with a laptop and
virtualization software (VMWare or VirtualBox) as we would actually be
writing Puppet code. The attendee would leave with

  * An understanding of how Puppet works
  * A working Puppet Master and test node
  * How to automate deploys in their infrastructure
  * Best Practices
  * How to implement common design patterns
  * Use of Hiera to separate data from their code
