title: Building a Business Continuity Plan with Bareos and rear
slug: rear_bareos

category: proposals

 # Abstract
Business Continuity (BC) Management is often confused with Disaster Recovery
(DR) Planning as often BC steps are mentioned as part of a DR handbook.
During this talk we will highlight what BC is all about and how to get started
with it. Creating a DR Plan for certain key systems is only a small part of BC
Management and as an example we will illustrate how a central backup server
(using Bareos backup software) plays an important role in DR scenarios of
keys systems of your datacenter. However, when the backup server itself is lost
you need to foresee a recovery plan for it as well.
To fill that gab you could use a disaster recovery tool such as
Relax-and-Recover (rear) to restore the Bareos server from bare-metal.
