Abstract
---------

Assuming that you know how to start Vim, go to insert mode, go back to normal mode, write your changes and quit vim (hint: `vi file`, i, <esc>, :w, :q), this talk will give you a global overview of Vim to go beyond these 4 basic commands. Still, since Vim has so many features, this will only be an introduction presenting you with just the tip of the iceberg. If time permits I'll try to show some of the material with small demo's.
