Infrastructures today are many and varied. This conference will show you how to manage a heterogeneous infrastructure based on Windows, Linux
with free software. Based on specific examples and feedback we'll show you how to manage the deployment and management of your clients
based on Windows or Linux centrally.

We will also show you how to manage in a unified manner while keeping the specifics of each operating system,
the problem of user profiles and deployment of applications on small links such as ADSL or VPN links.
