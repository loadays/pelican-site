title: Puppet v3 and data decoupling with Hiera
status: hidden
category: proposals

Abstract
---------
[Puppet](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet) is a configuration management tool for modeling system state.

This presentation would cover what's new in Puppet v3 and focus on decoupling
data from your modules with Hiera. With Hiera we can stop forking modules and
use them without any modification. We would go through Hiera on the command
line, its use in your modules, as well as covering different approaches and
best practices to defining your lookup hierarchy.
