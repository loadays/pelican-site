title: Integrating UEFI into Relax-and-Recover
status: hidden
category: proposals

Abstract
---------
The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware. UEFI is meant as a replacement for the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) firmware interface which is commonly used on most PC hardware. However, with the newest motherboards UEFI became the standard way of booting (under pressure of Windows8?). Relax-and-Recover (Rear) is an easy to use Linux bare metal disaster recovery solution available for all kind of Linux distributions. Rear is written in the bash language and is widely used these days. 

This talk will explain what UEFI is all about, how it works internally, how it can be configured and used. We will briefly discuss what Rear is, and the current status of the project. Furthermore, for the Rear developers among us we will explain how we integrated UEFI into Rear to recover a system relying on UEFI for booting up.
