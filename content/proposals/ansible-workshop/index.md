category: proposals

Abstract
---------
About every year new tools for systems management are being released that fill a certain niche, or exploit the possibilities of configuration management by using yet another implemlentation language or a single compelling feature. And from a cynical point-of-view, Ansible is not different. However the design principles behind Ansible make it an exciting new alternative that simplifies and redefines systems management.

Key features of Ansible:

 - modular design
 - requires no agent, uses SSH (or zeromq)
 - requires no PKI infrastructure
 - multi-tier orechestration
 - dead simple

This tutorial will highlight the following topics:

 - Introduction to Ansible concepts
   - Inventories, Facts, Playbooks, Modules, Plugins
 - Using Ansible for systems management
   - Running commands in parallel
   - Automate using playbooks
   - Reporting using Ansible API
 - Using Ansible for orchestration
   - Creating advanced playbooks
 - Using Ansible for provisioning
   - Integration with EC2, vSphere, KVM or RHEV
