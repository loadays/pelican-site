title: Being a Sysadmin at a company full of Sysadmins: Your communication skills will be tested.

category: proposals

Abstract
---------
When moving from the professional service team at Puppet Labs to the operations
team I was surprised to find that it was not my technical skill that needed
improvement, it was my human interactions skills.  At first I didn't understand
why.  I'd been interacting successfully with people all over the world up until
now.  I've put a lot of thought into what is so different and why being the
sysadmin is a room full of highly experienced *ex-sysadmins* is so challenging.

During this talk I'll share how I've changed my perspective and modified the
way I react to people bringing me new information.  How our team is interacting
with anyone interested in infrastructure and what benefits that interaction
gives the team.  Then wrapped up with what I am still working on and challenges
ahead.

Upon someone walking away from this talk I want them to leave aware of a handful
of skills that will help them communicate in an ever evolving devops
environment.  A place where boundaries between operations and development blur
and everyone seems to have an opinion.

Cody Herriges <cody@puppetlabs.com>

Cody started his career in the world of higher education infrastructure
management.  A world full of ever changing requirements and complicated sets
of software never meant to be consumed by your average end user, all while still
needing to keep running and supporting a full range of legacy implementations.
Keeping all these stacks of software in-line was only possibly through automation.
The longer he worked there the more crucial he found Puppet in the
success of day to day operations.

Cody joined Puppet Labs in 2010 as one of the original traveling consultants.
He traveled the world training and evangelising Puppet and standing up customer
infrastructures on the backs of Puppet modules.  Now a days he is a member of
the company's operations team where they're trying to solve many common problems
today's admins face plus a slew of unique problems to a company designing
infrastructure software.
