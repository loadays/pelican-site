title: Monitoring: state of the union
status: hidden
category: proposals

 # Abstract
 
 Monitoring is a critical part of any system, and part of the daily workflow for many system administrators. Yet there are so many different tools, projects and products that it can be difficult to know which one to use for each scenario.
 
 This talk will examine the open source world of monitoring, aiming to give an overview of each of the key tools and where they fit in. It will consider the history and future direction of such industry standard tools as Nagios, Cacti and statsd/collectd. It will consider newer tools such as Riemann, Bosun and Twitter's AnomalyDetection. Finally, it will quickly mention some of the commercial SaaS alternatives (New Relic, Datadog, Boundary, CloudWatch, Server Density) to running your own monitoring.
