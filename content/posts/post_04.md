As in previous years the Linux Professional Institute (LPI) wants
to offer PBT LPI exams at loadays.

LPI Certifications are globally accepted certifications that are:

- Designed by a community of Linux professionals, volunteers, vendors
  and educators.
- Challenging: if you don't know the subjects you won't pass.
- Accessible and available at thousands of test centres around the world
  or at special events.
- Of high quality: relying on critical input from numerous Linux experts
  and employing scientific and industry-recognized psychometric
  processes.
- Distribution-neutral: verifying knowledge on any standard Linux system.
- Relevant: surveying thousands to determine the skills that need to be
  tested.
- Supported and sponsored by a large number of Linux companies and
  projects.
- A certification the Linux community can respect and be proud of.

- Linux Essentials € 60,-

- LPIC-2  (201, 202) € 90,-
