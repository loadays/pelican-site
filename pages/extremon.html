    <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Designers and operators of critical systems like (nuclear) power plants, automated factories, and
power distribution grid management installations have always, by necessity, taken a functionality-
driven approach to command and control/monitoring technology, pragmatically using proven tech-
nology that is available at the time.
In these contexts, it has been taken for granted, for decades, that information about a system
is visualised on an exact schematic representation of that system, and that the information thus
visualized is the current, up-to-date state of the system at all times, regardless of the technology
used, and regardless of the distance between the system and the operator.
Recent developments in industrial SCADA systems recognize that systems have grown interde-
pendent, evolving from systems to supersystems, and urgently seek standardisation and interop-
erability.  What is sought is called Situational Awareness, which we consider requires a monitoring sys-
tem to be Real-time, Representative, Comprehensive, and to respect the cognitive strengths and
limitations of its human operators.</p>
<p>The IT sector, despite having successfully supported these other industries for decades and
being one of the most impacted by the evolution towards supersystems, remains decades be-
hind in terms of supporting Situation Awareness for its operators, remaining in a dispersed, non-
interoperable, out-of-date mode with representations requiring the extensive cognitive efforts much
like the dreaded “stove-pipe” accumulation of technologies that plague combat technologies and
that military designers have been actively trying to resolve for many years.</p>
<p>The ExtreMon framework intends to fix this, by providing real-time, representative, and comprehensive
collection, transport, aggregation and visualisation only requires a low to moderate amount of
resources.</p>
